# JupyterHub Package Management

Storing our JupyterHub packages in GitHub, this enables us to:

1. Get dependabot security alerts to vulnerabilities in our installed packages
2. Gain more insights into who wants which packages and why. We may eventually want to purge extraneous packages as this environment gets larger and larger

Please create an [Issue](https://github.com/Toronto-Big-Data-Innovation-Team/jupyterhub/issues) with package requests.
